  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS define a
  <code>command-line</code> procedure. While a useful baseline, the
  specification is not detailed enough to cover all practical
  situations. This SRFI clarifies the definition of
  <code>command-line</code> and adds a few related procedures.
  Scheme scripts, standalone executables, compilation and REPL use
  are accounted for. Option parsing is out of scope.</p>

  <h2 id="_rationale">Rationale</h2>
  <h3 id="_os_executables">OS executables</h3>
  <p>When a Scheme implementation is run on a conventional
  operating system, the OS runs an <em>executable</em>. An
  executable is a file that contains a program in a format suitable
  for the OS. In the case of Scheme, the executable can
  represent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A standalone Scheme program.</li>
    <li>A Scheme implementation.</li>
    <li>A virtual machine (such as the Java Virtual Machine or the
    .NET Common Language Runtime) hosting the Scheme
    implementation, which in turn hosts the Scheme program.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="_os_command_lines">OS command lines</h3>
  <p>The OS gives the executable a <em>command line</em>. The
  command line is a vector of strings. There is a ubiquitous
  convention that the first string represents the <em>command
  name</em>. Any remaining strings are <em>command arguments</em>
  interpreted differently by each program.</p>
  <p>Command lines are extremely portable. Practically all
  general-purpose operating systems provide them. Command names
  cannot be reliably interpreted as filenames.</p>
  <h3 id="_program_command_lines">Program command lines</h3>
  <p>The <code>command-line</code> procedure specified in
  R<sup>6</sup>RS and R<sup>7</sup>RS returns a list of one or more
  strings. As with OS command lines, the first string is by
  convention the command name. However, <code>(command-line)</code>
  is generally not the same as the OS command line.</p>
  <p>When an implementation is started for the purpose of running a
  Scheme program as a batch job, <code>(command-line)</code> is
  most often a tail of the OS command line such that <code>(car
  (command-line))</code> is the name of the Scheme program and
  <code>(cdr (command-line))</code> are the arguments given to that
  program.</p>
  <p>For example, if the OS command line is:</p>
  <p><code>fantastic-scheme --script program.scm foo bar
  baz</code></p>
  <p>the value of <code>(command-line)</code> generally is:</p>
  <p><code>("program.scm" "foo" "bar" "baz")</code></p>
  <p>Gambit Scheme supports running more than one program in the
  same batch job, with the ability to insert a <em>read-eval-print
  loop</em> in between any pair of programs. In that case the
  command line is given to the first program in the batch that
  starts with the Unix-style <code>#!</code> script indicator.
  Since it consumes all remaining arguments, that program also
  becomes the last program in the batch.</p>
  <p>When a Scheme program is turned into a standalone executable,
  <code>(command-line)</code> and the OS command line are generally
  equivalent. However, the Scheme implementation’s runtime system
  may omit command line options that belong to it. For example,
  Gambit omits the <code>-:</code> option.</p>
  <p>In a read-eval-print loop the value of
  <code>(command-line)</code> is not well specified. A reasonable
  convention from Chez Scheme is to use a zero-length string as the
  command name in this case, with no command line arguments after
  the name.</p>
  <p>Another ambiguous situation arises when using
  <code>load</code> or <code>import</code> to load some code into
  an implementation. When the implementation loads or imports a
  Scheme library or module to use as a main program, it should
  perhaps set the command name to the name of the module and give
  it any remaining command line arguments. If a library or module
  is loaded or imported to help with another program, and not as a
  main program in its own right, the command line should be
  <code>'("")</code> as in the REPL.</p>
  <h3 id="_taming_the_complexity">Taming the complexity</h3>
  <p>The interface defined by this SRFI is divided into two
  layers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The command layer (<code>command-line</code>,
    <code>command-name</code>, <code>command-args</code>)</li>
    <li>The script layer (<code>script-file</code>,
    <code>script-directory</code>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The command layer applies whenever we are running a Scheme
  program that is given its own command line (in the sense that the
  R<sup>n</sup>RS <code>command-line</code> procedure would return
  a useful command line concerning that program specifically). Such
  a command line is normally a tail of the OS command line, but may
  come from other places as well. Kawa offers a particularly large
  number of alternative ways to set it.</p>
  <p>The script layer applies whenever we are running a Scheme
  program from a source file. It does not apply to standalone,
  pre-compiled programs or libraries. The idea is that when running
  simple Scheme scripts, it is often convenient to have them read
  and write data files kept in the same directory as the script
  itself.</p>
  <p>A third layer to access the unabridged command line of the OS
  process is omitted. The process command line can be difficult to
  access from hosted environments such as the Java Virtual Machine,
  which would make this SRFI more difficult to adopt.</p>
  <h2 id="_specification">Specification</h2>
  <h3 id="_terminology">Terminology</h3>
  <h4 id="_top_level_programs">Top-level programs</h4>
  <p>For the purposes of this SRFI, the following <b>are</b>
  considered <em>top-level programs</em>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Scheme program turned into a standalone executable.</li>
    <li>A program whose filename is given on the Scheme
    implementation’s command line for the implementation to execute
    (with or without a command line option such as <code>-s</code>,
    <code>-script</code>, <code>--script</code>, or
    <code>--program</code>).</li>
    <li>A file loaded via <code>load</code> or equivalent from the
    REPL.</li>
    <li>A file loaded indirectly via a command line
    evaluate-expression flag (commonly <code>-e</code>).</li>
    <li>A library or module imported via a command line flag
    (commonly <code>-m</code>) for the purpose of running that
    module as a main program.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following <b>are not</b> considered top-level
  programs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A file loaded recursively via <code>load</code> from
    another file.</li>
    <li>A file loaded via <code>import</code> (except for a
    <code>-m</code> flag as above).</li>
    <li>Code evaluated in a REPL.</li>
    <li>A Scheme source file being <em>compiled</em> for use at a
    later time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, implementation-defined global options or optional
  arguments are permitted that control whether or not
  <code>load</code> treats files as top-level programs.</p>
  <h4 id="_commands_and_scripts">Commands and scripts</h4>
  <p>For the purposes of this SRFI, we classify a running Scheme
  program as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A top-level program given a command line is a
    <em>command</em>.</li>
    <li>A top-level program run from a source file whose filename
    is known to the implementation is a <em>script</em>. Note that
    a file being compiled and stored away for later execution is
    not a script; only a file loaded to be evaluated once
    immediately is a script. The file may actually be loaded from a
    compiled cache, as long as the source filename is used to
    identify it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A running program can be either a command, a script, both at
  once, or neither.</p>
  <h3 id="_command_procedures">Command procedures</h3>
  <p>(<code>command-line</code>) ⇒ <em>string-list</em></p>
  <p>This procedure is equivalent to the R<sup>6</sup>RS and
  R<sup>7</sup>RS <code>command-line</code> procedure, but
  specified in more detail.</p>
  <p><b>R<sup>6</sup>RS definition:</b> "Returns a nonempty list of
  strings. The first element is an implementation-specific name for
  the running top-level program. The remaining elements are
  command-line arguments according to the operating system’s
  conventions."</p>
  <p><b>R<sup>7</sup>RS definition:</b> "Returns the command line
  passed to the process as a list of strings. The first string
  corresponds to the command name, and is implementation-dependent.
  It is an error to mutate any of these strings."</p>
  <p><b>Additional stipulations by this SRFI:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the calling program is <b>not</b> a <em>command</em> in
    this SRFI’s terminology, a list equal to <code>("")</code> is
    returned.</li>
    <li>If the calling program is a standalone executable, the
    command line is equal to the command line of the operating
    system process, except that arguments belonging to the Scheme
    runtime system are omitted. (Such arguments start with
    <code>-:</code> in Gambit and Chicken.)</li>
    <li>If the calling program is a <em>script</em> as well as a
    <em>command</em>, the command name is equal to the filename
    given to <code>load</code>, on the command line, in an
    environment variable, etc. The command args are the args (if
    any) that belong to the script.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, if the command name comes from a filename, the
    filename is preserved as given to the implementation.</li>
    <li>It is an error to mutate a <code>(command-line)</code> list
    returned by the implementation, or any of the strings in
    it.</li>
    <li>Implementations are encouraged to have
    <code>command-line</code> as a parameter object. In that case,
    the implementation binds the value of the parameter as above
    for the duration of the command. The program may freely rebind
    <code>command-line</code> to any other string list containing
    at least one element, either temporarily with
    <code>parameterize</code> or permanently.</li>
    <li>If a program rebinds the <code>command-line</code>
    parameter, the new binding may share structure with the old
    binding.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(<code>command-name</code>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns a friendly version of <code>(car
  (command-line))</code> evaluated in the current lexical
  environment.</p>
  <p>If <code>(car (command-line))</code> is a zero-length string,
  <code>#f</code> is returned to indicate "not a command".</p>
  <p>Otherwise a friendly command name is typically derived from a
  filename as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The directory part (if any) is removed.</li>
    <li>Filename extensions known to belong to executable files or
    Scheme scripts on the underlying operating system are removed
    at the discretion of the implementation. For example,
    <code>.exe</code> or <code>.scm</code>.</li>
    <li>Other changes may also be made according to local
    conventions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, both the Windows filename <code>C:\Program
  Files\Fantastic Scheme\fantastic-scheme-1.0.EXE</code> and the
  Unix filename <code>/usr/local/bin/fantastic-scheme-1.0</code>
  would be typically shortened to
  <code>fantastic-scheme-1.0</code>.</p>
  <p>(<code>command-args</code>) ⇒ <em>string-list</em></p>
  <p>Returns <code>(cdr (command-line))</code> evaluated in the
  current lexical environment.</p>
  <h3 id="_script_procedures">Script procedures</h3>
  <p>(<code>script-file</code>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns an absolute pathname pointing to the calling script.
  Symbolic links are not resolved.</p>
  <p>(The script may or may not be a command; use
  <code>command-name</code> to find out.)</p>
  <p>If the calling program is not a script, <code>#f</code> is
  returned.</p>
  <p>Implementations must resolve the absolute pathname of a script
  before running that script. The script may change the working
  directory, thereby changing the interpretation of relative
  pathnames.</p>
  <p>(<code>script-directory</code>) ⇒ <em>string?</em></p>
  <p>Returns only the non-filename part of <code>script-file</code>
  as a string. As with <code>script-file</code>, this is an
  absolute pathname.</p>
  <p>The string should end with a directory separator (a forward
  slash on Unix; a backslash on Windows; an appropriate character
  on other operating systems) so that <code>string-append</code>
  can be easily used to build pathnames based on it: for example,
  <code>(string-append (script-directory) "my-data-file")</code>.
  However, if appending such a separator would make the pathname
  invalid on the underlying operating system, the separator is not
  added.</p>
  <p>If the calling program is not a script, <code>#f</code> is
  returned.</p>
  <h2 id="_implementation">Implementation</h2>
  <p>Due to the highly environment-dependent nature of the SRFI,
  there is almost nothing that can go into a portable sample
  implementation. Implementations have been done for Gauche
  (<a href=
  "https://github.com/shirok/Gauche/blob/master/src/execenv.c"><code>src/execenv.c</code></a>
  and <a href=
  "https://github.com/shirok/Gauche/blob/master/lib/srfi-193.scm"><code>
  lib/srfi-193.scm</code></a>) as well as Chibi-Scheme (<a href=
  "https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme/pull/619/files"><code>main.c</code>
  and <code>lib/srfi/193.sld</code></a>).</p>
  <p>It is not possible to implement this SRFI based on the
  R<sup>n</sup>RS <code>command-line</code> procedure. However, the
  <code>command-line</code> procedure from this SRFI can serve as a
  conforming implementation of R<sup>n</sup>RS
  <code>command-line</code>, and implementations are encouraged to
  merge these procedures where possible.</p>
  <h2 id="_acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>Thanks to Shiro Kawai for the initial implementation in
  Gauche, for patiently reviewing iterations of the design and for
  valuable feedback that solved key problems in it. The interplay
  of <code>command-line</code>, <code>command-name</code> and
  <code>command-args</code> was especially tricky to figure out and
  I had all but given up hope of a satisfying solution. With
  Shiro’s insight a simple and natural approach was finally
  found.</p>
